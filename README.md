# Deformers
There are two versions of deformers:

1. probeDeformer is a simple vertex based deformer which ignores mesh structure. It is applicable to any mesh and particles.
2. probeDeformerARAP is a mesh based deformer which try to preserve geometry (ARAP). It is applicable only to "clean" meshes; it is recommended first "cleanup" the target mesh by "Cleanup" => "Remove Zero edges, faces" in Maya's mesh menu.

# Algorithm
For the detail of the algorithm, refer to the papers
- "Probe-Type Deformers" by S. Kaji and G. Liu
in Mathematical Progress in Expressive Image Synthesis II, Volume 18 of the series Mathematics for Industry pp 63-77,
http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-55483-7_6?no-access=true

# How to compile:
- For Mac users, look at the included Xcode project file ( or Makefile )
- For Windows users, look at the included Visual Studio project file. __DO NOT__ turn on AVX or you'll get an exception.
- on some systems, specifying the compiler option -DEIGEN_DONT_VECTORIZE may be necessary to avoid compilation errors (thank giordi91 for this information)

# How to use:
1. Place the plugin files in "MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH"
2. Place the UI python script files in "MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH"
3. Open Script editor in Maya and type in the following Python command:

```python
import ui_probeDeformer as ui
ui.UI_ProbeDeformer()
```

To visualise vertex color, go to "Display" => "Polygon" => "Custom Polygon Display"
and tick "color" and select "emission."

# LIMITATION:
The ARAP version works only on "clean" meshes.
First apply "Cleanup" from "Mesh" menu
to remove zero area faces and zero length edges.
